A final project for Yale's Analysis of Baseball Data Course

### TL;DR

Trevor Bauer seemed to accuse the Astros pitching staff of using illegal substances to doctor baseballs in 2018. That same year, Gerrit Cole was a splashy acquisition for the Astros. This project compares Gerrit Cole's spin rates to those among a small group of MLB pitchers using Statcast data. 

### data

The .zip file in this repo contains a cleaned dataset with info for only the pitchers named in the Bubba Harkins lawsuit (see [this ESPN article](https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/30671790/fired-los-angeles-angels-clubhouse-attendant-names-pitchers-ball-doctoring-case)). If you're curious about Statcast data for more pitchers, [Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search) has a GUI interface that lets you search all available Statcast data.

### some more elaborate background

[Statcast](https://www.mlb.com/glossary/statcast) started tracking spin rates for individual pitches across all Major League ballparks in 2015 [(NYTimes)](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/22/sports/baseball/statcast-offers-a-way-to-quantify-baseballs-every-move.html). Generally speaking, pitches that spin more tend to move more. Pitchers across MLB have looked for ways to increase spin rates for all of their pitches. Through the years, ball-doctoring practices have developed, which theoretically facilitate better grip of the baseball. 

Brian "Bubba" Harkins worked for the Los Angeles Angels for 38 years before he was fired in March 2020 [(Halos Heaven)](https://www.halosheaven.com/2021/1/8/22220863/los-angeles-angels-mlb-news-scandal-brian-bubba-harkins). Harkins had been accused of providing a mixture of pine tar and rosin to players around Major League Baseball. Since his dismissal, Harkins has filed a lawsuit against MLB and the Angels, contending that "MLB and the Angels have artificially created a one-person scandal" [(ESPN)](https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/30671790/fired-los-angeles-angels-clubhouse-attendant-names-pitchers-ball-doctoring-case). In the lawsuit, Harkins claims that he provided his pine tar-rosin mixture (nicknamed "Go-Go Juice") [(LA Times)](https://www.latimes.com/sports/angels/story/2020-03-06/angels-employee-bubba-harkins-sold-homemade-substance-pitchers-applied-to-baseballs) to current and former Angels: Troy Percival, Brendan Donnelly, Kevin Jepsen, Cam Bedrosian, Keynan Middleton, Yusmeiro Petit, Luke Bard, Matt Andriese, Dylan Peters, Jose Suarez, Kaleb Cowart and Dylan Bundy; as well as other pitchers around MLB, many of them aces: Gerrit Cole, Justin Verlander, Edwin Jackson, Max Scherzer, Felix Hernandez, Corey Kluber, Joba Chamberlain, Adam Wainwright and Tyler Chatwood (ESPN).

Ball-doctoring has been a practice for decades [(NYTimes)](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/sports/baseball/foreign-substance-ball-doctoring.html). Only this year, however, has MLB started collecting baseballs after games, announcing plans to analyze spin rates in hopes of catching pitchers who use foreign substances to doctor baseballs, perhaps because the Harkins lawsuit brought ball-doctoring out into the open. Trevor Bauer, who plays for the LA Dodgers, has been particularly outspoken about how many pitchers in MLB frequently use substances to help grip baseballs better and boost spin rates, even accusing the Astros pitching staff of doing so in 2018 [(Sports Illustrated)](https://www.si.com/mlb/2018/05/02/trevor-bauer-houston-astros-spin-rate-pine-tar). Now, Bauer finds himself at the center of MLB's investigation, likely in part because of his willingness to speak up (NY Times).  

As Bauer has argued in the past, and as the recent lawsuit suggests, other pitchers are likely guilty of using substances to grip baseballs better, boost spin rates, and subsequently achieve more movement on their pitches. Indeed, the lawsuit presents an interesting opportunity to evaluate spin rates for specific pitchers. Here, I wanted to know whether Gerrit Cole, who was traded to the supposedly-cheating Astros in 2018, had higher spin rates after he was traded. I compare Gerrit Cole's spin rates before and after the trade, also using a number of qualified pitchers who were also named in the Harkins lawsuit for further comparison.
